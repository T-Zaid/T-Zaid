### Greetings!! I'm Zaid - aka **T-Zaid** üëã

the "T" is for **Tiger**, my IGN, irrelevant, anyways, a quick overview about myself

## I am a Student, developer, and digital writer !!

- üéì I'm a student at Fast NUCES Karachi, Pakistan. Currently leveraging studies in BS Computer Sciences.
- üåü Believe in Language agnosticism, and a keen learner for new frameworks.
- üïπÔ∏è Driven student who has an undying interest and enthusiast in Web Dev, Game Dev and 3d engines platforms.
- üö© Consider myself a problem solver and logic builder, no matter the language paradigm.

## Welcome to Tiger CodeVerse
where I enlist all of the projects that I've made in University to keep track and tabs about the progress that I have achieved throughout the years of my student life. Click the **heading** of a project to see in-depth details

#### 1. [Text-Based Adventure Game](https://github.com/deijiokzen/Semester-1-Game-with-Arrays)
A text-based adventure/puzzle game that challenges the player with puzzles and mini-games, containing visuals, sounds, and a basic story. The play area is displayed through 2-Dimentional array, so the player's position is also saved in that array in the Bridges/Hallways Puzzle. This is done through functions which read files through file pointers and print the characters in the file when the point threshold is low/high enough.

#### 2. [Cafe Jasmine Management System](https://github.com/T-Zaid/Cafe-Jasmine-Management-System)
The Cybernet Cafe Management System is a multifaceted system that allows up to 5 quintessential participants of the Jasmine Cafe to access their accounts. It is robust enough to support every account separately and without the need to access a specific user-type portal individually. It not only oscillates between all of these 5 participants but also allows "Non-Account Functionality, such as booking an offline ticket, or viewing the User-Base Infographic data. Additionally, the Management System allows some ambitious features such as the ability to give feedback, chatting between seat occupants, being able to set the menu, auto generating the schedule routine the workers have to follow, defining the stock of technical equipment, all of which is supported by the permanency of filing and the extensive yet flexible usage of strings.

#### 3. [Full University Preparation Assistant](https://github.com/M-AliTanveer/FUPA)
A program to create and take quizzes under time constraints to prepare students for university entrance tests. It assists both students and teachers. This project is created in Intel x8086 assembly language using MASM assembler. Irvine's Library was used in the project as well as a set of Windows specific functions to enable clicking in the console for a partial GUI feel.

#### 4. [Ashanti Search Engine](https://github.com/Fawad-Javed-Fateh/Ashanti)
With the theme being Natural Language Processing (NLP), we developed a hybrid search utility application whose objective was to search the inputed words from a large corpus of text (poems in our case) and return the results in less than O(n) time. We used advanced data structures and some NLP technicques such as a Stop Word filter in order to compress and store our data set into a hashtable and reduce the searching time to be nearly constant in a corpus of more than 55k words. We also used ascii art to generate runtime graphs which provided the analysis of the frequencies of words in the documents as well as ranked the documents acc to their freuqencies.

#### 5. [Numerical Computing Project](https://github.com/deijiokzen/Semester-4-Numerical-Computing-Project)
This project challenged us to create algorithms for different complex problems that should not only utilizes simple arithmetic operations but can also work on any number of items in the statement. We have learned alot of things from the project that includes different ways to parse a numeric function and how to store them efficiently in every step of iteration to reuse in the next one.

#### 6. [Cafe Azula Database Management System](https://github.com/T-Zaid/Cafe-Azula-Database-Management-System)
A *successor* to our Semester 2 Cafe System Project. The Cybernet/eSports Caf√© Management System is a multifaceted system that encompasses entirely around the ease of our customers whilst keeping each of their public records and personal achievements intact and safe in our system. The availability of games with weekly, monthly and special events that increases the competition among our top and rising players. The system also manages the records of every staff with their supervisors. The system is interactive and robust enough to identify each account separately and without the need of individual user portals for customer and staffs. What keeps our gaming caf√© more competitive, interactive and exciting is the top 10 players of every game in our leaderboard system, top 3 players of each game at the end of month in the leaderboard system will get a chance to avail vouchers for themselves as a reward of their hard work and ultimate skills. The Esports event organized by cafe gets more exciting as there are special prizes waiting for the winners.

#### 7. [Fortuna Algorithms Design](https://github.com/T-Zaid/Algorithms-Design)
This project was dedicated for the subject of Design and Analysis of Algorithms. This project challenged us to go through different stages of file reading from a text where a certain complex patterns are getting followed and a tree (binary trees etc) is getting created out of the file with an in-built plotter. This is not the end, it was just the first step, one can use different algorithm on the created trees (such as Dijkstra, Boruvka's and many more..) Check it out in detail by clicking the heading.
